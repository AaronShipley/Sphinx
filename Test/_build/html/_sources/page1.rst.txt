This is our First Sphinx Page
==============================

This is our first attempt at writing sphinx documentation

* First we built a sphinx documentation
* Next we built our html pages
    * we built them with the "make html" command

This is a second header 
--------------------------

This is our test of the second header

* This is our new image that we uploaded

.. figure:: /image/Z2H-transparent.png
    :align: left
    :alt: Zero 2 Hero image
    :scale: 30%

    **This is an example image of the SZ2H logo with a caption**
